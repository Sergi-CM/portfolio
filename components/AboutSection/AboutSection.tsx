          Hey there! I'm Sergi, your friendly full stack developer with a
          passion for turning caffeine into code and ideas into reality. I
          navigate web development challenges, creating seamless user
          experiences.
          <br />
          <br />
          Beyond coding, I'm a fitness personal trainer, promoting the synergy
          of a healthy body and mind. On weekends, my alter ego emerges as a
          rock guitarist, finding a beautiful balance between the raw energy of
          music and the logical precision of coding.
          <br />

          Tap/hover on the image and you'll see! ðŸ˜œ
          <br />
          <br />
          What motivates me in life? It's the thrill of creating, whether it's a
          bug-free codebase, a killer workout routine, or a guitar solo that
          sends shivers down your spine. I'm a firm believer in the idea that
          passion is the fuel that drives innovation.
          <br />
          <br />
          So, join me on this adventure of variables, power chords, and personal
          records.
          <br />
